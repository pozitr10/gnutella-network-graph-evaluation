# gnutella-network-graph-evaluation
Gnutella Network Datasets are evaluated via Networkx Package

This work is conducted for the course CSE5004- Graph Theory & Algorithms in Dokuz Eylul University

Goal of the project is as follow:

Gnutella network is an example of Peer-to-peer networks. In this kind of systems, HOP number is a key actor for efficiency and speed of data flow. In this project, 6 different/seperated Gnutella Network datasets are tested with 3 well-known shortest path algorithms that are: Dijkstra' Shortest Path Algorithm, Bellman-Ford and A* as Shortest Path.

Datasets are taken from SNAP Stanford Dataset library. Thus, copyrights of this networks belong to SNAP library.

This python code can be modifable and usable for 3rd parties but needs citation as well.
